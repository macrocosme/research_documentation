# DDL - Create a new database called 'Examples'

CREATE DATABASE Examples;

# A line starting with the symbol '#' is a comment and is not considered as code by the database engine.

# 'USE' specifies to set the database 'employees' as default. This will avoid us having to specify the database in our queries 
#															(e.g. FROM database_name.table_name, or FROM `database_name`.`table_name`) 
USE Examples;
