    <p>Welcome to our demonstrator of a user interface for human in the loop active learning. Motivated by the problem
        of galaxy and black hole evolution, we use active learning to enhance the use of an expertâ€™s time by suggesting
        interesting examples for annotation. This project builds upon the successes of citizen science projects to
        construct a catalogue of morphologically classified active galactic nuclei. By managing the
        exploration-exploitation trade-off, active learning is a machine learning approach that uses annotator effort
        more efficiently.</p>
